# Superuser NFT

Not an NFT at the moment. As it stands, only a smart contract that has state for

    1. DSO coordinate
    2. DSO name

which can be queried publically. 

Smart contract owner solely has the rights to execute "Veto" which is a placeholder for whatever priveleged actions Superusers will be able to take, and also the sole ability to transfer ownership.

## Minting
